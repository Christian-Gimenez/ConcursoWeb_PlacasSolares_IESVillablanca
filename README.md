# Web Design Contest for IES Villablanca 🌞💻

Welcome! 👋  
This repository contains the project I created for the **Web Design Contest at IES Villablanca**. The challenge was to design a responsive and functional web interface in **CSS**, based on a demo application that displayed electricity generation data from the school's **solar panels**.  

I'm thrilled to share that my work won the contest and was showcased at my school! 🏆🎉

## About Me 💻

I'm a **Junior Backend Developer** with a passion for web design and development. Although my main focus is backend, I enjoy the creative challenges that come with **UI/UX design** and **frontend development**. This contest brought me back to my roots, reminding me of the joy I first found in coding during my studies in the **Higher Vocational Training in Web Application Development** (*Grado Superior de Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Web*).  

This project was not only a technical challenge but also an opportunity to showcase my skills and contribute to my school community! ✨

## Project Highlights 🌐

The project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with a primary focus on the **web layout and design**. Here are some key features of the design:

- 📊 **Interactive Visuals**: Displays real-time electricity generation data through a dynamic chart.
- 💡 **Clean and Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- 🎨 **Modern Aesthetic**: Focused on usability and visual appeal.

This contest allowed me to put my CSS and design skills to the test, and I'm proud of the final result!

## Why I Love Web Design ❤️

Web design combines logic, creativity, and problem-solving in a unique way. Here's a little JavaScript snippet to celebrate this passion:

    console.log("I <3 designing and coding beautiful websites! 💻✨");
}
showLove();
```
